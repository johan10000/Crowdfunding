# Crowdfunding

1 Introduction


1.1 What is crowdfunding?
Crowdfunding is the practice of funding a project or venture by raising money
from a large number of people, typically via the internet.
1.2 Issues in crowdfunding
1.2.1 Intellectual property risk
If a startup chooses to use a crowdfunding platform, it runs the risk that someone
else may take the idea and run with it.
1.2.2 Scams
The crowdfunding platform company may run away with people’s money.
1.2.3 Lack of Transparency
Many crowdfunding platforms don’t make it easy to find out what is going
on behind the scenes. Many platforms hide a lot of information from backers.
For instance, they may not tell you how many people have backed a particular
project to create a “scarcity” effect and encourage people to invest before it’s
too late.
1.2.4 Wrong Censorship
Most popular crowdfunding platforms have strict rules that projects must adhere
to in order to be listed. If a project violates any single rule, it will not get funded,
even if people want to back them.
1.3 Solution
Blockchain- Using smart contracts.
The smart contract sets-
• Target
• Deadline
• Minimum contribution
The crowd sends money(ether) to smart contract.
To extract money from the smart contract, 50% and more crowd should
agree to let the ether out.
We allow contributor to take back the money if deadline or target is not met
